    "The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is the *quantum* excitation of the Higgs field, which permeates all of space. The Higgs field is responsible for giving mass to other elementary particles through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Without the Higgs field, particles like quarks and electrons would be massless, and the universe would be vastly different. At high energies, the Higgs field has a symmetrical state with zero value. As the universe cooled, the field took on a non-zero value in all of space, breaking the symmetry. Particles interacting with the Higgs field gain mass. The more strongly a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more massive it becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Higgs boson was first proposed by Peter Higgs in 1964, along with independent contributions by François Englert and Robert Brout, as well as other physicists. The prediction emerged from the need to explain how particles acquire mass. The electroweak theory, which unifies the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force, required a mechanism to endow particles with mass while preserving the gauge symmetry of the theory. The Higgs mechanism provided this solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confirmation of the Higgs boson took place at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland, using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider, capable of accelerating protons to near-light speeds and then smashing them together. Two main experiments at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, were designed to detect the Higgs boson among other particles. These detectors are vast, sophisticated machines capable of tracking the particles produced by collisions. Protons were collided at very high energies, producing a wide range of particles. The Higgs boson is unstable and decays into other particles almost immediately. Physicists looked for specific patterns in the decay products that would indicate the presence of a Higgs boson. Some key decay channels included: two photons (γγ), two Z bosons (ZZ) which further decay into four leptons, two W bosons (WW), two tau leptons (ττ). Enormous amounts of data were analyzed to identify excess events over the expected background that matched the predicted properties of the Higgs boson. On July 4, 2012, CERN announced that both the ATLAS and CMS experiments had observed a new particle with a mass around 125-126 GeV (giga-electronvolts), consistent with the predicted Higgs boson. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science played a crucial role in the discovery of the Higgs boson. The process involved massive amounts of data collection, processing, and analysis, which required advanced Data Science techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "ATLAS and CMS Detectors collected data from billions of proton-proton collisions per second. Each collision produced a vast amount of data, leading to petabytes of data being generated annually.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Data Processing**\n",
    "Real-time data filtering systems called triggers were used to identify potentially interesting events. These systems reduced the data from billions of events per second to a manageable number of events for further analysis. Sophisticated algorithms selected events that matched the expected signature of Higgs boson decays. The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) was used to store and process the massive amounts of data. It linked computing resources from institutions around the world.\n",
    "4. **Data Analysis**\n",
    "Scientists used hypothesis testing to determine if the observed data deviated significantly from the background noise and matched the expected signal for the Higgs boson. P-values were calculated to determine the statistical significance of the observed excess. A discovery required a 5-sigma significance level, meaning the probability of the result being due to random chance was less than one in 3.5 million. Machine learning algorithms were employed to recognize complex patterns in the data and to distinguish between signal (potential Higgs boson events) and background (other types of events); supervised learning techniques were used to classify events based on their characteristics, improving the accuracy of identifying Higgs boson events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Frame the Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions in high-energy particle accelerators are crucial for discovering exotic particles and require Data Analysis approaches to solve 'signal' (1) versus 'background' (0) classification problems. **'Shallow' Machine Learning models** have been limited in their ability to learn complex nonlinear functions, leading to a meticulous search for **manually constructed nonlinear features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advances in the field of **Deep Learning** have allowed for learning more complex functions **directly from the data**, without the need for manually constructed features. Using benchmark datasets, Deep Learning methods have been shown to significantly improve classification metrics by up to 8% over the best current approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "While current approaches in high-energy physics have improved with manually constructed physics-inspired features, Deep Learning has proven to be more effective in automatically discovering powerful combinations of nonlinear features. Advances in Deep Learning, such as the use of neural networks with multiple hidden layers, have shown promise in improving the discrimination capability between signals and backgrounds in high-energy physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These developments in Deep Learning could inspire new advances in Data Analysis tools to address more complex problems in high-energy physics and could have applications in identifying decay products in high-dimensional raw detector data.\n",

    "[The Higgs boson detection data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs) has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations.

This variability suggests significant diversity in the physical quantities measured, reflecting the complexity of particle interactions.\n",
    "4. **Moderate to High Variability**: Attributes such as lepton_pT, missing_energy_magnitude, and m_jj, m_jjj, m_lv, m_jlv, m_bb, m_wbb, m_wwbb (mass measurements) display moderate to high variability as indicated by their standard deviations. This variability implies that these attributes can significantly differ from one observation to another.\n",
    "5. **Balanced Dataset**: The label attribute, which likely represents a binary classification (possibly signal vs. background events), has a mean around 0.5. This suggests a balanced distribution between the two classes, which is important for training classifiers without a class imbalance bias.\n",
    "6. **Typical Values and Central Tendencies**: Attributes like lepton_pT and missing_energy_magnitude have means close to 1, indicating that their typical values are centered around this average. This central tendency helps in understanding the baseline values for these measurements.\n",
    "7. **Standard Deviations**: The standard deviations across various attributes provide insights into the spread or dispersion of data points around their respective means. Higher standard deviations indicate greater variability, while lower ones suggest more clustered data points.\n",
    "8. **Measurement Specificity**: Attributes related to jets (jet_1_pt to jet_4_phi) show specific measurements related to momentum (pt), pseudorapidity (eta), and azimuthal angle (phi) for up to four jets per event. Each of these attributes contributes uniquely to understanding the characteristics of jet formations in particle collisions.\n",

Also known as sensitivity or recall, **True Positive Rate (TPR)** is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual positives. **False Positive Rate (FPR)** is the ratio of incorrectly predicted positive observations to the actual negatives. The ROC curve is generated by varying the threshold for the classification model to determine what is considered a positive or negative prediction.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FPR or Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FPR} = \\frac{\\text{False Positives}}{\\text{False Positives} + \\text{True Negatives}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the ROC Curve:\n",
    "- The curve plots TPR (y-axis) against FPR (x-axis). \n",
    "- A model with good predictive power will have a ROC curve that hugs the top left corner of the plot. This indicates high TPR and low FPR. \n",
    "- A random guess model would produce a diagonal line (45-degree line) from the bottom left to the top right, representing a TPR equal to FPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "***AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)*** is a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the ROC curve, reflecting the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the AUC Area:\n",
    "- 1.0: Perfect model. The model perfectly distinguishes between positive and negative classes.\n",
    "- 0.8 to 0.9: Considered excellent. Models with AUC in this range have a high capability to differentiate between classes.\n",
    "- 0.7 to 0.8: Considered acceptable. These models generally perform adequately in distinguishing between classes.\n",
    "- 0.5 to 0.7: Considered reasonable. The closer to 0.7, the better the model's performance in distinguishing between classes.\n",
    "- 0.5: No discrimination. The model performs no better than random guessing.\n",
    "- < 0.5: Indicates a model that performs worse than random guessing, which typically indicates issues with the model or data."

    "\n",
    "1. **Boosting Technique**: Sequentially combines weak learners to create a strong learner, improving predictive accuracy iteratively.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Gradient Boosting**: Optimizes model parameters using gradient descent, reducing prediction errors by fitting new models to residuals.\n",
    "4. **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting and enhances generalization with techniques like tree pruning and feature subsampling.\n",
    "5. **Efficiency**: Utilizes parallel and distributed computing for scalability, handling large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "6. **Cross-validation and Early Stopping**: Supports hyperparameter tuning and prevents overfitting with cross-validation and early stopping techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also manage the behavior of this method using manually hyperparameters, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **n_estimators**: This hyperparameter controls the number of trees in the ensemble, influencing the model's overall complexity and performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **learning_rate**: By adjusting this hyperparameter, we determine the step size of each tree's contribution during the boosting process, affecting the rate of convergence and the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "4. **max_depth**: This hyperparameter specifies the maximum depth of each tree in the ensemble, influencing the complexity of individual trees and, consequently, the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "5. **early_stopping_rounds**: This hyperparameter allows the model to automatically halt training when the performance metric on a validation dataset stops improving for a specified number of consecutive boosting rounds (early_stopping_rounds). This helps prevent overfitting, and ensures efficient use of computational resources. It enhances model robustness by stopping training at the point where further iterations no longer improve validation performance, thereby optimizing model training and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following function, **tracking time** (start_time, end_time, run_time) ensures transparency regarding the computational cost of training. The predicted probabilities (y_pred_proba) are crucial for tasks such as computing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC)."

    "### 5.2. Multilayer Perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) are a type of artificial neural network composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neurons (Units)**: Neurons receive input signals, process them, and produce output signals. They are organized into layers: input, hidden, and output.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Layers**:\n",
    "    - *Input Layer*: Receives raw input data, with each neuron representing a feature.\n",
    "    - *Hidden Layers*: Perform nonlinear transformations of input data to learn abstract representations.\n",
    "    - *Output Layer*: Produces final predictions or outputs based on learned representations.\n",
    "      <p></p> \n",
    "3. **Connections and Weights**: Neurons in adjacent layers are connected by weighted connections, determining signal strength. Weights are adjusted during training to minimize prediction errors.\n",
    "4. **Activation Functions**: Introduce nonlinearity into the network, enabling complex mappings between inputs and outputs. Common functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.\n",
    "5. **Feedforward Propagation**: MLP use feedforward propagation to compute predictions. Input data passes through the network, undergoing weighted sums and activation functions at each layer.\n",
    "6. **Training**: Typically conducted using supervised learning, where the network learns to map input data to target outputs. Training involves forward propagation, backpropagation for gradient computation, and weight optimization.\n",
    "7. **Versatility and Performance**: MLP are versatile models capable of learning complex patterns in data. They may require careful tuning and regularization to prevent overfitting, especially with high-dimensional or noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the differences between the two different MLP implementation architectures used: in this project:\n",
    "1. **Keras/TensorFlow**. Keras is a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow, a powerful framework for building, training, and deploying Deep Learning models. It offers extensive flexibility in defining neural network architectures, including the ability to create complex models with various types of layers (e.g., Dense, Convolutional, Recurrent) and custom activation functions. Keras also supports advanced configurations like dropout regularization, batch normalization, and custom training loops. It is well-suited for tasks requiring deep customization and control over the neural network architecture.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Scikit-learn**. Scikit-learn, on the other hand, is a general-purpose machine learning library in Python focused on simplicity and ease of use. It includes an MLP implementation primarily designed for traditional machine learning tasks like classification and regression. The MLP in Scikit-learn is defined using parameters such as hidden_layer_sizes, activation, and solver, offering a simpler approach to constructing neural networks compared to Keras. Scikit-learn integrates well with other scientific Python libraries and provides straightforward methods for model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following two MLP models, the importance given to Early Stopping and Loss Monitoring can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Stopping**: This mechanism helps prevent overfitting by stopping training when validation performance no longer improves. By doing so, it ensures that the model can generalize well to new data, as evidenced by a consistent reduction in validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train/Validation Loss**: Monitoring these losses provides crucial insights into the model's performance. Significant discrepancies between training and validation losses may indicate overfitting, where the model memorizes specific details of the training data instead of learning general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "These practices are essential for developing models that not only fit the training data well but also generalize effectively to unseen data, thereby enhancing their utility and reliability in practical applications."

    "\n",
    "To fine-tune the number of neurons in dense layers, dropout rate, and batch size in your MLPKeras function, we follow these guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Number of Neurons** in Dense layers: Adjusts the value to scale neurons in each dense layer. It's typical to start with a baseline number of neurons per layer, such as, for larger datasets, 128, or 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropout Rate** in Dropout layers: It refers to a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting during the training process, and works by randomly deactivating (or \"dropping out\") a fraction of neurons in a layer during each training iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch Size** in Fit function: Determines the number of samples processed before updating model weights, influencing training speed and generalization. If we have a large dataset and ample GPU memory, larger batch sizes might be suitable for faster training; for smaller datasets or when training on CPUs, smaller batch sizes might be necessary to fit into memory and ensure the model learns well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following function, **tracking time** (start_time, end_time, run_time) ensures transparency regarding the computational cost of training."

    "The following UMAP function visualizes the UMAP projection of the second-to-last dense layer outputs from a trained Keras MLP model. Applying UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to the penultimate layer of Deep Learning models is particularly useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capturing Abstract Representations**: The penultimate layer of a deep neural network often contains abstract and semantic representations of the input data. As data is processed through the layers of the network, it is transformed into higher-level representations that encapsulate complex and task-relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Representations in the penultimate layer typically have a relatively high dimensionality, which can make visualization and direct interpretation of learned patterns challenging. Reducing the dimensionality of these representations with UMAP preserves important data relationships while projecting them into a lower-dimensional space, facilitating visualization and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: Applying UMAP to the penultimate layer allows exploration of how the model organizes and separates data in a simpler and more interpretable representation space. This can reveal natural clusters in the data, separation patterns between classes, or important features learned by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Visualization**: Visualizing outputs from the penultimate layer provides insights into how the model processes and understands data. UMAP enables the creation of visualizations that help data scientists and researchers better understand the model's behavior and interpret its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Comparison**: By applying UMAP to outputs from the penultimate layer of different models, it is possible to compare how different neural network architectures or training parameters result in different data representations. This can be useful for model tuning or identifying specific aspects of the problem that each model captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, applying UMAP to the penultimate layer of deep learning is a powerful technique for exploring and interpreting the internal representations learned by the model, providing a clearer and more intuitive view of the learning process and data characteristics."

    "2. **Overlap Indicates Ambiguity**: The mixing of \"Signal\" and \"Background\" labels in the central area suggests that the boundary between these two clusters is not well-defined. This could indicate that the features used for clustering do not completely differentiate between the two labels, leading to ambiguity in classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outliers**: The presence of outliers, which do not fit into the main clusters or the mixed central area, indicates there are data points with unique features. These outliers may represent noise, rare cases, or potentially new subgroups that are not captured by the main clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implications for Further Analysis**: The overlap in the main area suggests that the model requires a larger dataset. It could be also beneficial to analyze the features of the data points in the mixed region to understand the source of overlap better and to explore if additional features or a different clustering approach might improve separation. The outliers should be investigated to determine their nature and relevance to the overall data structure."

The overlap remains, indicating some ambiguity, but it has decreased compared to the Low-Level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outliers Reduction**: The reduction in the number of outliers implies that the High-Level features have captured more relevant information, bringing previously outlying points into the main clusters or mixed area. This suggests a more robust clustering model with better-defined groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implications for Further Analysis**: The persistent central mixing region, extending from the bottom left to the bottom right, indicates that there is still some overlap between the features of the two labels; analyzing the data points in this area could provide insights into the nature of this overlap. The decrease in outliers suggests that the model's representation of the data has improved; further refinement could focus on enhancing feature extraction to further reduce the central overlap and increase cluster distinctiveness."

    "#### 5.2.2. Multilayer Perceptrons with Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn, a widely-used machine learning library, does not have built-in functionalities specifically developed for loss monitoring in its MLPClassifier for Multilayer Perceptrons. This capability is typically found in Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which offer more extensive tools for neural network training and optimization. So, in the following MLPScikit function, the manual implementation of early stopping with loss monitoring serves several critical purposes to ensure effective model training and performance evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Stopping**: Early stopping is crucial for preventing overfitting. It terminates the training process when the validation accuracy stops improving, thereby preventing the model from learning noise or specific details of the training data that do not generalize well. In the function, early stopping is manually implemented by monitoring the validation accuracy (val_accuracy). If there is no improvement in validation accuracy for a specified number of epochs (patience=5), training is halted early to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train/Validation Loss Monitoring**: Monitoring these losses provides insights into how well the model is learning and generalizing from the training data to unseen validation data. The Training Loss is calculated using the logarithmic loss (log_loss) between the predicted probabilities (y_train_pred_proba) and actual training labels (y_train); this metric helps assess how well the model fits the training data. Similarly, the Validation Loss is calculated using log_loss between predicted probabilities (y_val_pred_proba) and actual validation labels (y_val). It indicates how well the model generalizes to unseen validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following function, the following hyperparameters are finely tuned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Activation** Specifies the activation function used in the MLP (e.g., 'relu', 'sigmoid'). Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model, enabling it to capture complex patterns in the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solver** Determines the optimization algorithm for weight optimization ('adam', 'lbfgs', 'sgd'). Each solver has its advantages depending on the dataset size, complexity, and available computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Epochs**: Refers to the number of complete passes through the training dataset. Each epoch involves forward and backward propagation, updating model parameters to minimize training loss and enhance performance iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, **tracking time** (start_time1, start_time2, end_time1, end_time2, run_time1, run_time2) ensures transparency regarding the computational cost of training."

    "Based on the analysis and interpretations of AUC values for Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) with Keras, and MLP with Scikit-learn, let's delve deeper into how Deep Learning methods, especially MLPs, excel over shallow models like XGB, particularly when dealing with raw or Low-Level features in high-energy physics data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning vs. Shallow Models in Handling Low-Level Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering and Model Performance:**\n",
    "   - **XGB Performance (Low-Level):** XGB achieves an AUC of 0.675 with low-level features, indicating moderate performance. This suggests that XGB, while capable, struggles to extract complex patterns directly from raw or minimally processed data without additional feature engineering.\n",
    "   - **MLP with Scikit-learn Performance (Low-Level):** Similarly, MLP with Scikit-learn achieves an AUC of 0.706 with Low-Level features, slightly better than XGB. This indicates that Scikit-learn MLP, with its neural network architecture, can leverage some nonlinear relationships but still requires feature engineering to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deep Learning Advantages (Low-Level Features):**\n",
    "   - **MLP with Keras Performance (Low-Level):** In contrast, MLP with Keras achieves an AUC of 0.725 with Low-Level features, demonstrating improved capability compared to XGB and Scikit-learn MLP, even with a relatively small dataset of 1 million observations. This improvement suggests that Keras, with its TensorFlow backend, allows for more flexible and deeper model architectures that can learn intricate patterns directly from raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Pattern Learning:**\n",
    "   - **Capability of Deep Learning:** Deep learning, particularly MLPs implemented with Keras, excels in learning complex nonlinear functions directly from data without relying heavily on manually constructed features. This is crucial in high-energy physics where discovering subtle patterns in raw detector data is paramount.\n",
    "   - **Advantages Over Shallow Models:** MLPs with Keras can automatically discover and leverage powerful combinations of features, especially Low-Level, to enhance classification accuracy. This ability reduces the dependence on domain expertise for feature engineering, thereby accelerating model development and improving adaptability to varying data characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Flexibility and Optimization:**\n",
    "   - **Backend and Architecture:** Keras provides a robust framework optimized for neural network computations, which enhances the efficiency of model training and inference. This backend optimization is particularly advantageous in handling large-scale, high-dimensional data typical in particle physics experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning methods, especially MLPs implemented with Keras/TensorFlow, outperform shallow models like XGB when dealing with Low-Level features in high-energy physics data classification tasks. The ability of MLPs to autonomously learn complex patterns from raw data underscores their superiority in capturing nuanced distinctions between Signal and Background classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future advancements in high-energy physics data analysis:\n",
    "- **Automated Feature Discovery:** Deep Learning's capability to automatically extract discriminative features from raw data can lead to more accurate and robust classification models.\n",
    "- **Reduced Manual Intervention:** The reduced need for manual feature engineering allows physicists to focus more on scientific insights and less on preprocessing data, potentially accelerating discoveries of exotic particles and phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, leveraging Deep Learning, particularly MLPs with Keras, represents a significant step forward in addressing the complexities of high-energy physics data analysis, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency in classification tasks."
